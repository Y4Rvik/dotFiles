About
---

I believe that IT is more about craftsmanship rather about science
or art. For me it's similar to cooking. Anyone who try to make omelette know
that good kitchen and proper equipments are very crucial.  This repository
contain small but critical configs for widely used toolsets.  *But remember
"Your Hands Are Your Best Tools"*
